PS/PL I/O to send an instruction to, and retrieve from, the processor:

reset mem
waddress: instruction
data: instruction
perform task
clear channels
turn pulse on
perform task
the processor will trip an interrupt when it completes
turn pulse off
perform task
clear channels
raddress: Rd
perform task
clear channels

Once instructions are successfully performed, the software_stack needs to
  be imported

Once the software stack is imported, the ARM Thumb compiler needs to be
  implemented

A critical section part, which switches between asynchronous
 and synchronous input from both PS and PL, needs to be created.
